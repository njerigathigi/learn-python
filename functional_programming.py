# functional programming is a programming style that avoids side effects by performing 
# computation with the evaluation of functions and relying heavily on immutable data structures.
# By using this programming style, you can reduce the liklehood of bugs and make sure that 
# your programs are easier to maintain.

# When you use mutable data structures, their contents can be modified. 
# So if you use them to hold your data, then you run the risk of messing up your data set,
# since it can be changed.
